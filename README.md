# 🎉 News

[2025-9-5] **We relearse our paper: SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing. We plan to open source the training code and our proposed GUI parsing benchmark-ScreenParse with evaluation code soon.**

# Motivation

  <p><em>Comparison of the coordinate generation between prior methods (left) and ours (right).</em></p>
</div>

We utilize enhanced features instead of multiple discrete tokens to obtain continuous coordinate values, thereby improving the precision of grounding and speeding up the inference.

# ✨ Highlights

* 💫 **Robust Grounding and Parsing**: We are the first to introduce an end-to-end MLLM for GUI perception, which simultaneously achieves robust grounding and parsing on user interfaces, providing a comprehensive perception of semantics and structures.
* 🚏 **Route-then-predict Framework**: By processing semantics and coordinates of the element separately, our method improves precision in grounding by around 3% averagely and speeds up grounding and parsing by 5 times and 4 times in average.
* 🌍 **Parsing Benchmark-ScreenParse**: a benchmark for GUI parsing, which provides an evaluation for the performance of models in both locating specific elements and perceiving the overall structure of user interfaces.
* 👑 **Excellent Grounding and Parsing Performance** on various benchmarks.
